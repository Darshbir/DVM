This is my try at making a fully fledged  ticketing system for a hypothetical railway network to support both the passengers and the railway administration. {Primary database used is POSTGRESQL}

Users can register on the site and book tickets according to their requirements. The railway administration can create new trains and update existing train routes.

This is the basic user home page with normal search functionality.

A screen like this appears when you try to book your tickets in a train. This screen further prompts you to enter passenger details.

On successful booking, an email is received on your registered email address

There is a usual login option along with a choice to login through google (setup through allauth).

Admins can login through the same login screen but with their staff login credentials. They will be redirected to this screen.

The ban user functionality has a search field in which search could be based on username or email address as the staff fancies. The list and details of all users are not shown so as to respect privacy and provide minimum necessary data to identify a user.

The staff can update details of existing trains or even delete them as required.

Update screen is shown below and already has previous details of the train pre filed.

The booking cancellation page redirects to list of trains where you can view bookings for each train
