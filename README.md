This is my try at making a fully fledged  ticketing system for a hypothetical railway network to support both the passengers and the railway administration.

Users can register on the site and book tickets according to their requirements. The railway administration can create new trains and update existing train routes.
//It is in progress currently.//
Will soon be adding login through google, changing the databse from sqlite to postgresql, and other added admin functionality
